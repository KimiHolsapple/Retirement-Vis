      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">When selecting a retirement location there are many factors that must be taken into consideration. This project
        will identify the most desirable country for retirement through data analysis and web-based visualizations and explore what attributes makes this country the best.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The Global Technical Paper describes how to create the interactive 3D globe below, and use it to visualize the 8 most important retirement
        factors: purchasing power, safety, health care, cost of living,
        property price to income ratio, traffic commute time, pollution, and climate. The globe is divided at the country level, where
        the color of each country corresponds to itâ€™s quality of life
        index. This granularity is effective due to the unique styles
        of politics, culture, and economy of each country.</p>

      <h3>Where is the best country to retire? </h3>
      <h4> An exploration of the top 10 countries with best retirement conditions. </h4>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">Accoording to the Global Quality of Life Visualization for Retirement,  Switzerland, Denmark, Netherlands, Finland, Australia, Iceland, Germany, Austria, New Zealand, and Norway are the 10 countries with the highest quality of life
        indices respectively. But what differentiates these desirable countries?
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">The stacked bar charts are separated by their contribution to the quality of life score. The attributes that increase
        the quality of life score are visualized in the blue chart, and
        the attributes that decrease the quality of life score are
        visualized in the red chart.</h5>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-16">According to the visualization, Switzerland is the best
          country to retire in. Out of the top 10 countries, Switzerland
          has most of the highest positive retirement factor indices.
          Although Switzerland has the highest quality of life score, it also has a cost of living index far greater
          than any of the other top 10 countries. From this analysis
          of the 3D globe visualization along with the stacked bar
          charts, we can conclude that Switzerland is an excellent
          retirement destination suitable to retirees that can afford the
          exceedingly high cost of living. Similar analysis can be done
          on the remaining countries.

        For those living in the United States, picking a location in the same country might be a practical solution. 
        As retirement rates have increased during COVID, understanding prime factors in optimal location and state are 
        more important than ever for those contemplenting retirment. Our findings have shown Raleigh, North Carolina to 
        be the best city for retirees.
      </h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">
        In this segment we attempt a visualization on a Numbeo data set to determine best retirement locations by a quality of life index. 
        Important factors considered that were captured in this index were economics indicators like purchasing power, health factors, pollution, and entertainment factors. 
        A D3 choropleth visualization was created to display quality of life for states and their contributing cities. 
        It was found North Carolina held the best places to live with Raleigh being it's best city.
